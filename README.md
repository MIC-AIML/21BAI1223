# Potable-Water-Detector
GDSC 2023 Solution Challenge Submission
## Motivation
Our goal is to provide fast and accurate analysis to determine if water is drinkable. This project targets Goal 6 of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

## Tech Stack
We use TensorFlow for fast prototyping and its ability to run on mobile hardware.

## Dataset
We use the water potability dataset from Kaggle. You can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

## How the Prototype Works
The notebook contains an implementation of a basic model built on TensorFlow that can successfully differentiate between potable and non-potable water. To run the prototype, simply run the notebook in a default conda environment.
